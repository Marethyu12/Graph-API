About Graph API:

For APCSA spring break project, I decided to focus on making classes for various types graphs.

The details of the classes are found in Graph API UML.png, it covers lots of common graphs and its algorithms.
The code should be bug free since I ran several tests on them.
Also the code are clean and documented, it should be easy for anyone with basic computer science background to read and understand without any hesitation.
It's possible that I will add more classes.

You need Java little higher than 8 to be able to use and run my codes.
